### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is
responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete Milk -c 5`.

//TODO: modify `saveInventory()` later
![Delete Sequence Diagram](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

![Component Managers](images/ComponentManagers.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`
, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**
API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

![Logic class diagram](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is
   executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an item).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete Milk -c 5` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**
API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![Model class diagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component

- stores an `Inventory` object that represents the inventory data.
- stores an optional `Order` object that represents the current order data.
- stores a `TransactionList` object that represents the transaction history of orders.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the Model represents data entities of the domain, they should
  make sense on their own without depending on other components)

![Model Displayable class diagram](images/ModelDisplayableClassDiagram.png)

- The `Model` component interacts with `Ui` component through a `Displayable` interface.

![Model Low Level class diagram](images/ModelLowLevelClassDiagram.png)

Low level architecture of `Model` component:

- `Inventory` and `Order` are each consists of an `UniqueItemList` which contains `Items`.
- The `TransactionList` stores `TransactionRecord` which are the records of history orders.
- Each `TransactionRecord` has a unique id and timestamp, with a list of `Item` transacted in the history order.

### Storage component

**
API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

![Storage class diagram](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component,

* can save both inventory data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `InventoryStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the
  functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Ordering

### Implementation

When ModelManager is initialised, optionalOrder is set to Optional.empty(). 
At this point, the user has 1 order record with 2 items in his transaction list.

![Initial_State](images/OrderInitialState.png)

Step 1. The user enters ordering mode via the `sorder` command.

Upon entering the ordering mode, optionalOrder now has a new Order() which is empty

![Sorder_State](images/OrderSorderState.png)

Step 2. The user adds an item to the order via the `iorder` command.

Upon entering `iorder Banana c/1`, the order now contains 1 banana item.

![Iorder_State](images/OrderItem1State.png)

Next, upon entering `iorder Strawberry c/1`, the order now contains 1 strawberry item.

![Iorder_State](images/OrderItem2State.png)

Step 3. The user transacts the order via the `eorder` command.

After the transaction is done, optionalOrder is reinitialised to Optional.empty()

![Initial_State](images/OrderFinalState.png)

Step 4. The new transactions are saved to json file.

![Transact_Order_Sequence_Diagram](images/TransactOrderSequenceDiagram.png)

### Mutating Inventory

This section explains how various commands update the list of items and display the result.

As a background context, all the item objects are contained in a `UniqueItemList` object which enforces uniqueness between
items and prevent duplicates. The `Inventory` manipulates the '`UniqueItemList` to update its content which then update the
`ObservableList<Item>`. The `ObservableList<Item>` is bounded to the UI so that the UI automatically updates when the
data in the list change.

`UniqueItemList` is involved when the items are manipulated to ensure the uniqueness of the items. This, the design needs to
ensure that every command mutates the `UniqueItemList` through `Inventory`.

The general flow of inventory manipulation through AddCommand is as below:
1. The `AddCommand` object in `Logic` component interacts with `Model` component by calling the `Model#addItem()` if a
   new item is added and `Model#restockItem()` if an existing item is restocked.
2. The `Model#addItem()` and `Model#restockItem()` methods then call methods with the same method signature in `Inventory`, `Inventory#addItem()` and `Inventory#restockItem()`.
3. The `Inventory` then manipulates the `UniqueItemList` by calling the methods with the same method signature, `UniqueItemList#addItem()` and `UniqueItemList#restockItem()`.
4. UniqueItemList then updates the `ObservableList#add` and `ObservableList#set` methods which updates the list to be returned to the user.
   The returned list has added a new item or incremented the count of the existing item.


Flow:`AddCommand` -> `Model` -> `Inventory` -> `UniqueItemList` -> `ObservableList<Item>`

The above flow applies for all the other similar commands that manipulates the inventory.
The detailed flow for each command is found below:

**`AddCommand:`**      
AddCommand#execute() -> Model#addItem() or Model#restockItem() -> Inventory#addItem() or Inventory#restockItem()
-> UniqueItemList#addItem() or UniqueItemList#setItem() -> ObservableList<Item>#add() or ObservableList<Item>#set()

**`RemoveCommand:`**    
RemoveCommand#execute() -> Model#removeItem() -> Inventory#removeItem() -> UniqueItemList#setItem() -> ObservableList<Item>#set()

**`EditCommand:`**       
EditCommand#execute() -> Model#setItem() -> Inventory#setItem() -> UniqueItemList#setItem() -> ObservableList<Item>#set()

**`ClearCommand:`**       
ClearCommand#execute() -> Model#setItem() -> Inventory#resetData() -> Inventory#setItems() -> UniqueItemList#setItem() -> ObservableList<Item>#set()

**`DeleteCommand:`**      
DeleteCommand#execute() -> Model#deleteItem() -> Inventory#deleteItems() -> UniqueItemList#removeItem() -> ObservableList<Item>#remove()

**`SortCommand:`**      
SortCommand#execute() -> Model#sortItem() -> Inventory#sortItems() -> UniqueItemList#sortItem() -> ObservableList<Item>#sort()

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect:**

* **Finding Multiple Names, Ids or Tags:** The FindCommand supports finding by multiple names, ids or tags.
`IdContainsNumberPredicate`, `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate` takes in a list of 
strings which allows storing of multiple predicates. The items in the list are then matched with each predicate to 
update the filtered list. Thus, the displayed list contains items that matches multiple predicates given.
